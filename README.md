# Retrospective website project 📹
Annual project 1ESGIJ 2022 (1st year at school) 🏢

This project was made three students from the ESGI, a school of computer developer in Paris, 11th.

The objective of this project was to create an online platform from scratch and all native that welcomed users who will be able to add each other, 
post publications that can be liked, hated and commented. 🔨

The site has several interesting pages such as the support help request page or even the application to a team position! ❗️

It has an easter egg in the page representing our pedagogical director in charge of supervising our annual project. ❓
